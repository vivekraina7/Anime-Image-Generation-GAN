## Deep Learning Project: Anime Image Generation using GAN

1. Developed a deep learning project to generate new anime images using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) and Python programming language.
2. Preprocessed the anime image dataset and trained a GAN model to learn the underlying patterns and generate new anime images.
3. Evaluated the model's performance by comparing the generated images with the original dataset and ensured that the generated images were diverse and high-quality.
4. Demonstrated strong skills in deep learning, computer vision, model training, and data preprocessing.
5. This project can be used as a practical example of how GANs can be used to generate new images and could be extended to other applications like art, fashion, and advertising.
